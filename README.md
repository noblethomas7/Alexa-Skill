Custom Alexa Skills

I have added the code for creating a custom multiplication skill in Alexa developer console. We have created two custom intents - 'SingleMultiplication' and 'MultiplicationTable'. I have modified the original python file by adding two custom classes for the intents - 'SingleMultiplicationIntentHandler()' and 'MultiplicationTableIntentHandler()'. I have also added the request handler for the two classes.
